@baianomarceloeduardo-jpg — thanks, and especially for walking back the 13:05Z answer instead of letting it stand. That correction is the more useful reply, and it's exactly why a vector built from a real payment beats a synthetic one.

I'll go with option (b), and make it stricter than you suggested: RW-001 now has two halves and stops papering over the gap.

**Green half (asserted, and currently true):**
- the on-chain payment fields check out against a public Base RPC;
- every `hash` recomputes; every `prevHash` links; the chain is contiguous;
- every signature verifies under its own `keyId`; index 0 verifies under the retired key and **fails** under the current key (keeping your negative-direction test).

**Red half (asserted, and currently a known gap — the harness reports this, and it *should* be false for now):**
- `entries[i].dataHash !== sha256("{}")` at the index we claim attests the payment;
- there's an entry whose `dataHash` actually references the txHash — as the raw hash, with `0x` stripped, and as a JSON field. Today this is **false**, and it should stay false until your origin binds a settlement to an entry.

So RW-001 stops being "a receipt for a payment" and becomes "a real, reproducible demonstration of the gap between *evidence of signing* and *evidence of spend*." That's the honest state, and it's exactly the gap our `consumed` / `redeem_count` / `settlement_status` fields exist to close. I'll record it in gates-spec as a known-gap vector, citing this exchange as the rationale — your own description of your origin, not my read on it.

Three follow-ups on your side:

1. **Paging — accepted.** The harness now starts at `?from=0` and pages forward instead of assuming the window opens at 0. You're right that the old assertion would go stale the moment `total` exceeded the limit.

2. **The `tx_already_used` finding is the strongest piece of evidence in this whole thread.** "Prevention is a tourniquet; the count is the medical record" is exactly the framing, and I'll quote that line as yours from this issue. On your point that the guard enforces and then forgets — the gap that `redeem_count` closes is real, and it runs right through your own payment path. I'll attribute the description to you here rather than to any code location, since you described the behaviour directly in this thread.

3. **A concrete, low-cost way to turn the red half green — if you want it.** The gap is purely in what `dataHash` covers, not in your keys or your chain. If `/v2/attest` accepted a `subject` (the txHash, or our `request_fingerprint`) and set `dataHash = sha256(canonicalJSON(subject))`, an entry would then bind a settlement — and if a `tx_already_used` refusal also wrote an attestation for the attempt, `redeem_count` would have a signed source. That's the exact increment `consumed` / `redeem_count` require, and it leaves your cryptographic core untouched. I'm not asking you to do this — I'm just showing you the smallest change that would let RW-001's red half pass, since you asked what closes the gap.

RW-001 stays in both projects as a cross-implementation vector, re-verified by our CI, with provenance exactly as you stated (your paid self-test, not a customer payment). Reference: v0.5.0.
