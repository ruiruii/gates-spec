@baianomarceloeduardo-jpg — thank you. This is exactly the definition pressure the proposal
needed, and all three points land. I've changed the spec and the reference implementation
rather than just arguing back.

**1. `redeem_count` as attempts observed by the seller — accepted, and already how the
middleware behaves.**

`packages/middleware/src/index.mjs` increments the counter *before* `verifyPayment` and
before the guard decides anything:

```js
// --- redemption counting happens BEFORE we decide anything else ---
const { count, resources, firstSeen } = await store.incr(proofHash, resourceId);
```

So a replay, a retry, or a *refused* second redemption all increment. SPEC §5.4 now reads:
"Count of `complete` events observed by the seller for this `proof_hash`, including replays,
retries, and refusals." I dropped the word "accepted" — your EIP-3009 point is right: under
`exact` the nonce is single-use, so a *completed* second redemption is structurally
impossible, and a field defined as "accepted" would read as broken forever at `1` rather
than as evidence.

**2. `consumed` as an attestation, not a seller predicate — accepted, and it cost us a
feature.**

I had a convenience path where the buyer could report consumption inline via
`x-gates-consumed: yes` and the merchant would sign it. That is precisely the unfalsifiable
seller self-report you describe, so I removed it. SPEC §5.3 now carries a role constraint:

> A VSR whose `signer.role = merchant` MUST set `result.consumed` to `unknown`.
> `consumed = yes | no` MUST be signed only by the `agent` role (the buyer runtime) or by an
> independent `observer` role that can demonstrate downstream reference.

The merchant keeps `delivery.status`; the buyer signs `consumed`; `linkReceipts()` binds the
two into `completeness = bilateral`. And yes — the default is `unknown`, never `no`.
Absence of a downstream reference is not evidence of idle spend.

**3. Settlement in-flight — I think you've found a real gap and I don't know the right
answer.**

Your three-state marker (settled / settlement-in-flight / unpaid) is a good catch: without
it, a seller that waits on settlement reports "not delivered" for a payment that is merely
in flight, which corrupts the delivery predicate. Our envelope separates `delivery.status`
from `payment.redeem_count`, but does not standardize a settlement state.

Question: do you want that as its own predicate in §5, or as a `payment.settlement_status`
field that gates whether the delivery predicate is evaluated at all? I'd rather follow your
structure than add a fourth predicate nobody asked for.

**Next step, if you want it.** I can open a PR against your SPEC adding an `outcome` block
under §5 carrying `consumed` (payer/observer-signed, default `unknown`) and `redeem_count`
(seller-observable attempts), plus a mapping from Ed25519 VSRs to your EIP-712 / EAS
receipts. If you'd rather keep this as an issue until naming settles, say the word and I'll
wait — I'm equally happy to adopt your names and retire mine. The objective is one
vocabulary, not a new project.
